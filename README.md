# simgrep

**work in progress**

`simgrep` is a command-line tool for semantic search in local files. it aims to find text snippets based on meaning, not just exact keywords.

currently, it can:

* extract text from a single file.
* chunk the extracted text.
* generate embeddings for the query and text chunks.
* (more features planned as per [architecture](docs/architecture.md) document)
