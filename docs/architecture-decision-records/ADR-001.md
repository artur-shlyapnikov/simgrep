# ADR-001: Use DuckDB for Metadata Storage

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2024-05-24

## Context

`simgrep` needs a storage solution for rich, relational metadata associated with text chunks (e.g., source file path, character offsets, content hashes for updates). This is necessary because the primary vector search library (`usearch`) only stores vectors and their integer labels.

The required solution must be:
1.  Performant for lookups and joins.
2.  Embedded & Zero-Configuration for a simple CLI user experience.
3.  Dual-Mode, supporting both persistent (on-disk) and ephemeral (in-memory) storage.
4.  Robust, ensuring data integrity.

## Decision

We will use **DuckDB** as the metadata store for `simgrep`.

This establishes a clear architectural separation:
*   **`usearch`** handles fast vector similarity search.
*   **`DuckDB`** handles storing and querying all descriptive metadata (file info, chunk text, project configurations).

The search workflow is to first get matching vector labels from `usearch`, then retrieve their full context from DuckDB using those labels.

## Consequences

### Positive

*   **High Performance:** DuckDB is an in-process, columnar (OLAP) database optimized for the analytical queries `simgrep` needs.
*   **Excellent User Experience:** Being an embedded library, it requires no external server or configuration from the end-user.
*   **Data Integrity:** SQL schemas, transactions, and foreign keys guarantee a consistent and uncorrupted index.
*   **Architectural Clarity:** This choice follows the "do one thing well" principle. It lets `usearch` focus on vector math and DuckDB on data relationships, simplifying maintenance and extension.
*   **Flexibility:** Natively supports both on-disk persistence for projects and a fast in-memory mode for ephemeral searches.

### Negative

*   **Two Data Stores:** The application must manage and synchronize writes between `usearch` and DuckDB. This is a manageable trade-off for the significant benefits.

## Alternatives Considered

*   **SQLite:** A strong alternative, but its row-based (OLTP) architecture is less optimized for `simgrep`'s analytical query patterns compared to DuckDB's columnar (OLAP) design.
*   **JSON / Flat Files:** Rejected due to poor scalability, lack of data integrity, and the high complexity of implementing relational queries manually.
*   **Integrated Vector Databases (e.g., ChromaDB):** Rejected as they are often heavyweight services requiring external setup, which conflicts with the goal of a simple, self-contained CLI tool. The `usearch` + `DuckDB` combination provides similar power in a fully embedded form.
